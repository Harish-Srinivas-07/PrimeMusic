## New Feature: Download Option 📥

We are excited to introduce a new feature to PrimeMusic – the ability to download your favorite songs directly from the application. This enhancement further expands the utility of PrimeMusic, enabling users to access their preferred tracks offline.

### Technical Implementation ⚙️

#### Blob & Fetch API

- **Blob Object**: When a user selects the download option, the audio data of the currently playing song is fetched using the Fetch API. This data is encapsulated within a Blob object, which represents binary data in the form of a file-like object.

- **Blob URL**: A Blob URL is generated for the Blob object using `window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)`. This temporary URL provides direct access to the audio file within the browser environment.
